Universal Studios Japan (USJ) has announced that they will be holding a limited-time Halloween show for "Pokémon" this autumn. 

Since spring, various characters from different works have been gathering at the park for the "NO LIMIT! Parade," and "Pokémon" made its first appearance in the park. However, the newly announced event will be a standalone event. It is said to be the first show featuring Pokémon in the park's history.

◆ "DJ Pikachu" and "DJ Gengar" will deliver an extremely exciting experience!

At the event, "DJ Pikachu" wearing an original costume and the first-ever appearance of "DJ Gengar" will liven up the participants with an "extremely exciting experience" in a party venue created with USJ's overwhelming scale and quality.

They will deliver Japan's first daytime show where you can immerse yourself in the world of Pokémon and dance along to lively music and flashy visuals.

◆ Other "extremely exciting Halloween programs" will be prepared this autumn!

In addition, this autumn, other "extremely exciting Halloween programs" that go far beyond imagination, including additional information about Pokémon, will be prepared for a limited time.
