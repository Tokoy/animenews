Bandai Namco Entertainment has announced that it will release a memorial book for the social game version of "Idolmaster SideM," which ended its service in January this year, on March 15, 2024 (Psycho Day). It is said to have an astonishing volume of over 6,000 pages.

◆ Twice the size of the Kojien dictionary

The social game version of "Idolmaster SideM" is a game where you produce male idols, the first in the "Idolmaster" series. The three representative characters became popular with the catchphrase "For a reason, they became idols!" as they transitioned from being a lawyer, doctor, and pilot.

Although the game was launched on February 28, 2014, it soon went into maintenance after its release. It was forced to take a long break until July 17 of the same year due to the need for "larger-scale renovations than expected." As a title that has been loved for over 8 years since its start, it was operated until January 5, 2023.

In the memorial book, not only card illustrations and in-game magazines released during those 8 years, but also unpublished settings such as costumes, relationship charts, and cards of idols that were not implemented in the game, as well as newly drawn illustrations, will be included.
