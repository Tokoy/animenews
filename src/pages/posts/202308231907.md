On August 12th and 13th, "Comic Market 102" was held at Tokyo Big Sight, and about 260,000 people visited the venue over the two days. The first day was scorching hot with the sun beating down, but the second day was cooler due to the rain. The number of exhibitors was higher than the previous event, and many companies used cosplayers at their booths, with cosplayers and photographers crowding the cosplay photography area.

At the event, KAPI-san (X: @KAPI_827MP), a half-Japanese and half-Indonesian cosplayer, showcased her cosplay of Kamisato Ayaka from "Genshin Impact".
