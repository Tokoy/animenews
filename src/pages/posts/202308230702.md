"My Melody & Kuromi's Happy Halloween Greeting" will be held at Universal Studios Japan (USJ) during the Halloween season. The popular Sanrio characters, Kuromi and My Melody, will appear together for a limited time starting from September 7th. Last year, they made their first appearance at USJ during Halloween and were very popular.

This year, two types of churros will be sold as collaboration food: "#WorldKuromizationPlan★Churros ~Salted Caramel~" with a cute black and purple devilish color scheme for Kuromi, and "My Melody's Happy Churros ~Strawberry Milk~" with a cute pink and white girly color scheme. They will be available for purchase from September 4th.

In addition, collaboration goods such as headbands inspired by the new costumes for this event of Kuromi and My Melody will also make their first appearance. Matching outfits will make the event even more enjoyable. Cute chocolate sets with packaging featuring Hello Kitty, My Melody, and Kuromi are also available for purchase, and various items such as charm sets featuring Kuromi, My Melody, and Hello Kitty will be gradually released.

Starting from September 6th, Kuromi's song "Greedy Greedy," released as an artist, will collaborate with the popular attractions "Hollywood Dream The Ride" and "Hollywood Dream The Ride ~Backdrop~" for a limited time.
