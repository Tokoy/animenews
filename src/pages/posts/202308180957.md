Level Infinite has announced a collaboration between the smartphone/PC game "Goddess of Victory: NIKKE" and "NieR:Automata" starting from September 1st. 

In this collaboration, characters from "NieR:Automata" such as "2B (YoRHa No.2 Type B)" and "A2 (YoRHa Type A No.2)" will appear as collaboration-exclusive characters. Additionally, "Pascal" will also make an appearance, and various collaboration events with original stories will be held for a limited time. It is worth noting that voice actress Yui Ishikawa will be voicing both "Lapin" and "2B". Furthermore, collaboration-exclusive weapons inspired by "2B" will also be available, so they are also worth looking forward to.

The collaboration between "Goddess of Victory: NIKKE" and "NieR:Automata" will begin on September 1st. "Goddess of Victory: NIKKE" is currently available for free with in-app purchases on smartphones and PCs.
