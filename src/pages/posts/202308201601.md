『呪術廻戦』第2期「懐玉・玉折」とアウトドアブランド「OUTDOOR PRODUCTS」のコラボ 第2弾商品が登場。現在、「プレミアムバンダイ」にて予約を受け付けている。

"Jujutsu Kaisen" collaborates with outdoor brand "OUTDOOR PRODUCTS" for the second time, and the second collaboration product has been released. It is currently available for pre-order on "Premium Bandai". "Jujutsu Kaisen" is a hugely popular comic series by Gege Akutami, with a cumulative circulation of 80 million copies. The first season of the TV anime aired from October 2020 to March 2021, and the prequel to the main story, "Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College," was made into a movie titled "Jujutsu Kaisen 0: The Movie," which was released in December 2021. The second season of the TV anime, which started in July 2023, depicts the story of Gojo Satoru and Naito Kento during their technical college days in "Kaikyaku Tamashii" and the continuation of the timeline from the first season in "Shibuya Incident". The newly announced goods are two items, a "Jujutsu Kaisen x OUTDOOR Collaboration Second Edition Backpack" and a "Shoulder Bag". Both items come in three models inspired by Gojo Satoru, Naito Kento, and Fushiguro Megumi, and feature original design fabrics in each character's image color as the lining. The zipper pull parts are designed with Gojo's eyes, Naito's earrings, and the Manri no Kusari motif, making them a unique item that highlights each character's personality.
