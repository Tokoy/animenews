『シルバニアファミリー』がファミリーマートで展開する「シルバニアファミリー キラキラくじ」が今年の夏も登場！全6種類の景品には、「かわいいリンゴの木のおへや」などが含まれます。

“Sylvanian Families” will release the “Sylvanian Families Kirakira Lottery” at FamilyMart this summer. The lottery will be available at selected FamilyMart stores from August 26, 2023, at 10:00 am. 

“Sylvanian Families” was first released in 1985 and has been loved in over 70 countries and regions as a dollhouse toy series that expresses the life of animal characters in a gentle and dreamy forest. The elaborate designs of houses, dolls, and furniture, which are both cute and detailed, are full of charm. 

In 2020, it celebrated its 35th anniversary, and the friends who live in Sylvanian Village continue to be loved by people of all ages and genders, from children to adults. The new anime series, “Sylvanian Families Flair's Go For Dream!”, has been airing on TOKYO MX since July 6, 2023. 

The “Sylvanian Families Kirakira Lottery” this time is themed around “Let's Play in the Secret Forest,” which imagines the world of “The Big Waterfall in the Secret Forest,” which was released in August 2023. The lineup includes friends dressed in costumes inspired by mushrooms, flowers, and other motifs that evoke the secret forest, allowing you to enjoy an adventure like exploring the secret forest.
