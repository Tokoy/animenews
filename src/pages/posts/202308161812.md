DetonatioN, the company that operates the professional gaming team "DetonatioN FocusMe (DFM)," announced on August 15th that they have terminated the player contract with tol2, a member of the "League of Legends (LoL)" division. They stated that tol2 has been removed from the roster of the division.

tol2 had previously revealed on Twitter (now X) on July 6th, 2023, that he had experienced harassment and intimidation from the coaching staff and CEO of the team. Specifically, he mentioned receiving threats from coaches Kazu and Ceros, feeling unsafe in the gaming house and escaping from it, and reporting the harassment to a senior in the industry. He also claimed that DFM's CEO, Nobuyuki Umezaki, told him that if he reported the harassment again, he would not be allowed to participate in the LJL (domestic league of LoL) and would have to pay a fine.

In response to these allegations, DetonatioN announced on July 7th that they have terminated the contracts with Kazu and Ceros, acknowledging that there were statements that could be perceived as harassment and denial of character by the two individuals. Furthermore, on July 28th, they announced a 50% reduction in CEO Nobuyuki Umezaki's executive compensation from August 2023 to July 2024 as a measure of accountability for the coaching staff's actions.

It is stated that the termination of tol2's contract is a mutual agreement reached through the involvement of both parties' lawyers. DetonatioN also mentioned that they will provide updates on the team's future direction and tol2's future activities as soon as they are determined.
