In the PV, there is a scene where he exchanges words with the water god, Freina, but he seems to be struggling with her free-spirited personality and does not hesitate to express his dissatisfaction with her, despite her being a god. </p><p>In this character introduction, it is revealed that his elemental attribute is "water," but the part that is usually written as "God's Eye" is now "???". The same goes for his constellation, which is also "???," deepening the mystery.</p><p>In addition, the gossip magazine "Seven Kingdoms Post" has released the following cryptic information obtained from the public:</p><blockquote><p>"For example, even if there really was a hero of the night in this world, I think it would only be their false appearance. When they wake up in the morning and brush their teeth, they are still their true selves, but only at night do they become the hero of the night. But Novelette is not like that. Both the appearance of the Supreme Judge and the appearance of our Merujine's 'ideal and wonderful dad' are his true selves. The only thing that is not him is the name Novelette, which he represents."</p></blockquote><figure class="ctms-editor-image">![image](https://www.inside-games.jp/imgs/zoom/1224333.jpg)<figcaption>※Image quoted from "Genshin Impact" official website.</figcaption></figure>
</figcaption></figure><h2>◆リオセスリ（CV：小野大輔）</h2><p>リオセスリ是罪人流放地“梅洛皮德要塞”的管理者。他随身携带着手铐，可以说是监狱的所长。他被称为“问题解决的老手”和“比外表更老练”，看起来是一个相当优秀的人物。</p><p>然而，对于这些赞美，他的反应是“不要误会。他们只是想要一个能过规律生活的地方……我只是给了他们需要的‘安宁’而已。”他似乎对罪人有所思考。</p><p>他拥有的神之眼是“冰元素”。此外，他似乎也是芬特纳的“公爵”。</p><figure class="ctms-editor-image">![image](https://www.inside-games.jp/imgs/zoom/1224330.jpg)<figcaption>※图片引用自《原神》官方X。</figcaption></figure><hr><p>根据官方介绍，通常会在接近版本发布时实装被介绍的角色。预计他将在4.1版本中登场。</p>
