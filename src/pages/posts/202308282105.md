Samzap has released the key visual for the original story of the new smartphone app "Jujutsu Kaisen Phantom Parade". This game is the first smartphone game based on the TV anime "Jujutsu Kaisen". The story is depicted from various perspectives of the anime's characters and is fully voiced.

During the second official live broadcast on August 28th, a digest video of the main story and the key visual of the "Fukuoka School Arc" were revealed. In addition, original illustrations for "Fanpare" that did not appear in the TV anime "Jujutsu Kaisen" were also revealed.

In "Fanpare", you can enjoy the world of "Jujutsu Kaisen" from both the perspective of the TV anime and the unique perspective of the game, all fully voiced. The main story "Retrospective" that reproduces the world of the TV anime allows you to experience the "Cursed Womb Arc" to the "Shibuya Incident Arc" with beautiful still illustrations and Live2D.

The main story "Fukuoka School Arc" can be read after progressing to the "Shibuya Incident Arc" of the main story.
