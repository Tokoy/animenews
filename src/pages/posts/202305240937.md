"Our protagonist has been reincarnated into the world of an otome game as the villainess "Mariabell Tempest", a noble lady with a dreadful personality. Whenever the game's heroine reaches a happy ending, Mariabell would face a bad ending involving her being disgraced, going missing, or even dying. On top of that, the enabled ‘auto-mode’ is preventing Mariabell from choosing her own decisions however and whenever she wants. But on the 6th loop of the game, the the "auto-mode" causing her inevitable fate finally deactivates! Now, in order to survive and live peacefully, Mariabell will have to take advantage of her knowledge and experience from the past five loops!

Subaru launched the manga on Square Enix's manga website Gangan Online in July 2020. Square Enix published the manga's fifth volume on March 10.
