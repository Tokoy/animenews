<p>Bandai Namco Entertainment has announced two new characters for the 3D fighting game "<b>Tekken 8</b>".</p>
<h2>Raven makes a comeback from "Tekken 6"!</h2>
<p>Raven is an agent belonging to the International Cooperation Union's Independent Force, who fights using ninjutsu. He is a character that returns from "Tekken 6". With his special stance called "Soul Field", he can perform versatile attacks such as long-range strikes, clones, and teleportation.</p>

<p>Raven, who has become more solid in appearance compared to his previous appearance, has returned to the game due to the belief that with the current hardware performance and the expressive power of Unreal Engine 5, a more evolved version of Raven can be showcased. He will have a deeper involvement in the story and play an important role in the decision to sanction G Corporation led by Kazuya Mishima.</p>
<h2>A new character with the nickname "Coffee Queen"!</h2>
