CAPCOM unveiled a new trailer for the upcoming free "VR (virtual reality) Mode" for its remake of the Resident Evil 4 game during the PlayStation Showcase 2023 livestream on Wednesday. CAPCOM has not yet revealed a release date for the free update.

The VR mode will be compatible with the PlayStation VR2 device for the PlayStation 5.

The game released for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 24, and has sold over 4 million copies worldwide as of April 7. The game has a "reimagined storyline," and a new graphical art style based on the company's proprietary RE engine.

CAPCOM released the Resident Evil 4 game for GameCube and later for PlayStation 2 in 2005. The company has since ported the game to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360, Xbox One, iOS and Android devices, and PC. The game shipped on Switch in May 2019. The game received a new virtual reality version for the Oculus Quest 2 headset system in October 2021. The game's story follows Leon S. Kennedy as he tries to rescue the U.S. president's daughter.

Resident Evil Village is the eighth entry in CAPCOM's Resident Evil survival horror game series. The game launched in May 2021 for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC (Steam and Stadia) platforms.
