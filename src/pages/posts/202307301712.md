Good Smile Company has started accepting pre-orders for a new figure of Chun-Li from the fighting game series "Street Fighter". 

◆ Chun-Li is brought to life based on Akiman's original illustration!

This product is a 1/6 scale figure that brings to life the "Medicine Notebook Illustration" that gained attention in 2022 through a collaboration between Capcom and Momochi Ham Pharmacy, under the supervision of illustrator Akiman. It faithfully recreates Chun-Li's beautiful figure standing among the rubble, temporarily away from battle. 

What catches the eye the most is the muscular legs that exude strength and grace. Not only the left leg peeking through the slit of the cheongsam, but also the right leg that was not visible in the illustration is truly "amazing".

The overall coloring also captures Akiman's exquisite color palette, enhancing the sculpt's shading and creating a captivating finish. Additionally, a drink bottle is included as an optional part to depict her taking a break.
