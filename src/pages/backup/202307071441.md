Konami Digital Entertainment has announced that it will add the new selection pack "Dread Conspiracy" and the new secret pack "Traps Lurking in the Devil's Castle" to the digital card game "Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel" on July 13th.

◆ "Dark World Dragon King Grapha" and "King of Shadows Levatein" implemented as UR!

In the new selection pack "Dread Conspiracy," "Dark World Dragon King Grapha," "King of Shadows Levatein," "Silver Princess of the Labyrinth Castle," and "Insect Queen of Atyps" will be implemented as UR. Additionally, "Demon Key Possessed God - Ashtartu" will be included as SR.

"Dark World Dragon King Grapha" was highly anticipated by many users due to the designation of "Dark World General Silvah" as a forbidden card, and it has been added promptly. The pack also includes new themes such as "Labyrinth" and "Insect Queen," which are popular in terms of visuals, making it a pack with high expectations.
